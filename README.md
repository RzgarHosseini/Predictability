# Quantifying the predictability of cancer progression using Conjunctive Bayesian Networks
Sayed-Rzgar Hosseini

The following is a pipeline for quantifying the predictability of cancer evolution based on Conjunctive Bayesian Networks (CBNs):


## Step 0: Downloading the CT-CBN software.
CBN model has been developed by Prof. Niko Beerenwinkel group and the software is free to download via the link below:

## Step 1: Preparing the genotype file.


## Step 2: Generating an initial DAG of restrictions using CT-CBN.

## Step 3: Generating the final DAG of restrictions and Lambda values using H-CBN.

## Step 4: Data Preprocessing.

## Step 5: Quantifying the predictability.
